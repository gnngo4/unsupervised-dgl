- unsupervised_models/ contains the implementation of unsupervised node
  embedding models
	a) Graph Autoencoders (gae.py)
	b) Variational Graph Autoencoders (vgae.py)
		i) Normal distribution
		ii) Powerspherical distribution
	c) Deep Graph Infomax (dgi.py)
- power_spherical/ contains implementation of power spherical distribution for
  s-vgae
